// Before beginning these exercises, you should read the instructions PDF,
// and look through the other code files in this directory for examples and
// hints. You only need to edit code in this file. There are comments here
// hinting at what you need to do, and "TODO" is written in various places
// where you need to edit some code in particular.

#include "GraphSearchCommon.h"

// =========================================================================
// EXERCISE 1: Adjacency List Utilities
//
// This exercise is based on the Week 3 lecture material.
//
// Our GridGraph class implements an "adjacency list" graph data structure,
// although it actually makes use of std::unordered_map and std::unordered_set
// to do this. You can read about GridGraph in the instructions PDF and by
// examining GridGraph.h. There are also various examples of GridGraph usage
// in the informal tests defined in main.cpp.
//
// Most of the GridGraph class is already implemented for you. For this
// exercise, you need to finish implementing two functions below:
//
// GridGraph::countEdges
// GridGraph::removePoint
//
// =========================================================================

// GridGraph::countEdges:
// This function should return the number of unique edges in the GridGraph.
// Remember that GridGraph doesn't explicitly store edge objects, but
// instead it stores point adjacency information. Since the graph edges are
// undirected, for any two vertices A and B, the edges (A,B) and (B,A) are the
// same edge. This means if we add up the sizes of the GridGraph::NeighborSet
// sets mapped in adjacencyMap, we'll be double-counting the number of edges.
// We can still use that to get the answer, or instead, the implementation of
// GridGraph::printDetails in GridGraph.h shows another method, by constructing
// a set of the unique edges only.
int GridGraph::countEdges() const {
  int numEdges = 0;

  // =======================================================================
  // TODO: Your code here!
  // =======================================================================

  return numEdges;
}

// GridGraph::removePoint:
// This function takes a point (an IntPair) as input, and it should remove
// all references to the point from the data structure. That means it should
// remove the point's key from the adjacency map, and it should also remove
// other points' references to it in the map, if those other points had been
// connected to it by implicit edges. It shouldn't change anything else about
// the graph.
void GridGraph::removePoint(const IntPair& p1) {

  // If the point p1 is not in the GridGraph, then do nothing and return.
  // (We use GridGraph::hasPoint for convenience. GridGraph already has
  //  various functions that may be useful. It's okay for class member
  //  functions to delegate tasks to one another.)
  if (!hasPoint(p1)) return;

  // All of p1's original neighboring points (that p1 was connected to with
  // edges, implicitly) have their own NeighborSet entries in adjacencyMap,
  // under their own point keys. You need to make sure that none of those
  // original neighbors refer to p1 any more.
  //
  // To help you, we've made a value copy of the original set of adjacencies
  // associated with this point. Note that the function GridGraph::removeEdge
  // alters the adjacencyMap entries for both of its input arguments. In
  // general, it can be dangerous business to add or remove items on an STL
  // structure while iterating over it, because this is prone to programming
  // mistakes. (When you tackle more advanced C++ projects in the future, you
  // can think about how to optimize your code so no unnecessary copies are
  // ever made, but the small speed benefits of that might not be worth the
  // risk of making mistakes! Until then, it's okay to make working copies
  // of small pieces of data like this.)

  const GridGraph::NeighborSet originalNeighbors = adjacencyMap.at(p1);

  // =======================================================================
  // TODO: Your code here!
  // =======================================================================

  // Finally, for the one point we are removing, erase the point key itself
  // from adjacencyMap directly. (There is no other GridGraph helper function
  // for this, because that's what we're implementing right now! We need to
  // use adjacencyMap's own erase function directly to erase the key.)

  // =======================================================================
  // TODO: Your code here!
  // =======================================================================
}

// =========================================================================
// EXERCISE 2: graphBFS
//
// This exercise is based on the Week 4 lecture material.
//
// The graphBFS function below largely implements the "breadth-first search"
// algorithm for the GridGraph class. You'll be asked to edit a few parts of
// the function to complete it. Those parts are marked with "TODO".
// (Please read the instructions PDF in case these hints are expanded upon
//  there.)
//
// Differences from the version of BFS discussed in lecture:
//
// - This implementation of BFS is geared toward finding the shortest path
//   from a start point to a goal point. So, it only explores within a single
//   connected component, and it may report that the goal is unreachable.
//   As soon as the goal point is found, our algorithm stops searching.
//
// - Our implementation uses sets of points to implicitly "label" points with
//   some status such as "visited", instead of assigning a label property to
//   a point itself. This lets us associate more than one kind of status with
//   any given point at the same time, by putting the point in several sets.
//   It's convenient to do this with STL containers like unordered set, since
//   we don't have to add some kind of status member variable to our own
//   classes like IntPair this way. It also means we don't have to initialize
//   a status for every vertex. In some graph search problems, such as later
//   in Exercise 3, the number of vertices is extremely large, so we'd rather
//   not have to initialize them all!
//
// - We use a map, "pred", to record the predecessor vertex of any newly-
//   discovered vertex during the search. This implicitly records what the
//   discovery edges are, as described in lecture. We can use that to rebuild
//   the path from start to goal at the end.
//
// - We do not assign status directly to edges. However, the vertex
//   predecessor information is basically recording the "discovery" edges.
//
// - We use a map, "dist", to record information about the shortest-path
//   distance to any given node that has been discovered so far. This is
//   similar to what Dijkstra's algorithm does, although with BFS graph search
//   when the edge lengths are all equal to 1, we know that as soon as we
//   discover a node, we have found the shortest path to it. We can still use
//   this to detect if we've taken more steps than expected and quit.
//
// - Redundantly, we have created a "dequeued set" that we use to help you
//   check for mistakes that could cause an infinite loop. This isn't normally
//   part of the BFS algorithm itself. In a way, this is mirroring what the
//   "visited set" is already supposed to accomplish.
//
// =========================================================================

// graphBFS:
// We use our GridGraph class where vertices are points (IntPair objects).
// The input consists of a start point, a goal point, and a GridGraph containing
// these points and the implicit edge information.
// We use BFS (breadth-first search) to find the shortest path from start to
// goal, if there exists any path at all. Then we return the path as a list of
// points. If there is no path, or if we take too many steps without success,
// then we return an empty list.
std::list<IntPair> graphBFS(const IntPair& start, const IntPair& goal, const GridGraph& graph) {

  // Intialization details -------------------------------------------------

  // maxDist failsafe:
  //
  // We'll hard-code a maximum distance for any shortest path through the graph
  // that we will consider before giving up. This isn't strictly necessary for
  // BFS to be correct; when a path can be found from start to goal, we'll find
  // the shortest such path and we won't alwaysneed to visit all of the vertices
  // before that happens anyway. But suppose the goal is unreachable from start;
  // then if the graph has a very large number of vertices, an unrestricted BFS
  // algorithm would have to explore all the reachable vertices before giving up
  // anyway, which could require a lot of time and memory if the graph is huge.
  // To avoid this issue, we can hard-code the maximum number of steps we will
  // allow before giving up. Of course, we must ensure that it's a reasonable
  // number. We might be able to estimate the maximum number of steps based on
  // the number of edges in the graph, for example. In the case of puzzleBFS
  // later in this assignment, there is a proven upper bound on the number of
  // steps needed.
  //
  // This is not very important for the small GridGraph examples we have,
  // but with a graph modeling problem like the puzzleBFS problem in this
  // assignment, the number of states implied in the graph is extremely large,
  // an exhaustive search could take a long time just to fail.
  constexpr int maxDist = 100;

  // Queue of graph vertices to explore next. This is an ordinary FIFO queue
  // (first in, first out), not a priority queue. When we say "explore" a vertex
  // in this assignment, we mean to dequeue it and loop over its adjacent vertices.

  // Map that associates a given point with its predecessor (the neighbor that discovered it first)
  // This will allow us to reconstruct the path once the goal is found.

  // Example usage: "pred[B] = A" records A as the predecessor of B, meaning that A discovered B.

  // Map that associates a given point with its shortest-path distance from the starting point.
  // This lets us see if we've taken too many steps (see the above comment about maxDist).
  // The simplest implementations of BFS don't need a distance record like this,
  // but it can be useful information, and other graph search algorithms like Dijkstra's
  // algorithm do need to use such a record.

  // re-enqueueing graph vertices that we've already enqueued for exploration.

// EXERCISE 3: puzzleBFS
//
// This time, we will use BFS to solve a graph modeling problem. This is
// where we model a realistic problem in terms of an imaginary graph, and
// then we can use graph search concepts to solve the modeled problem.
//
// (Please see the instructions PDF for a detailed introduction to this
//  problem, with illustrations.)
//
// The PuzzleState class represents one current state of the "8 puzzle",
// which is a puzzle played on a 3x3 grid containing 8 tiles, where a tile
// can slide into the blank space to shuffle the puzzle. Each state of the
// puzzle can be modeled as a vertex in an imaginary graph, where two states
// are virtually connected by an edge (adjacent) if a single tile move can
// transform the first state into the second state. We do not need a map
// structure for adjacencies since we can use the helper functions from the
// PuzzleState class to determine which states are adjacent at any given
// time. Therefore we also don't need an explicit graph class at all. It's
// important that we can use such an implicit graph representation, because
// the total number of vertices (states) and edges (moves) in the graph model
// for "8 puzzle" would be extremely large, and that would greatly impact the
// running time and memory usage. We don't need to examine every vertex or
// every edge in the graph model; we can just search from the start and quit
// after either finding the goal or giving up (in relatively few steps).
//
// This function is VERY similar to graphBFS, but now we are using the
// PuzzleState class to represent imaginary vertices instead of using IntPair
// to represent literal 2D points, and we do not use GridGraph. You should
// finish graphBFS first before trying this problem. The starter code shown
// below for puzzleBFS is so similar to graphBFS that the comments have mostly
// been removed.
//
// =========================================================================

// puzzleBFS:
// Given start and goal sates as PuzzleState objects, we perform BFS in the
// imaginary graph model implied by the start state, where the rest of the
// reachable vertices (states) and the edges leading to them (puzzle moves)
// can be figure out based on the tile sliding rules of the puzzle.
// If there exists any path from start to goal, then the puzzle can be solved,
// and we return the shortest path (which represents the solution steps).
// If there is no path to the goal, or if we take too many steps without
// success, then the puzzle cannot be solved, and we return an empty list.
